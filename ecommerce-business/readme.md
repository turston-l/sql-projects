### Tom's Pen Shop


* Tom has a nice and simple e-commerce business.

* He sells only one product: a super ergonomic pen.

* Recently, Tom ran an A/B test with ~2,000 users. To 30% of his audience he showed (and sold) a new pen design with a red case. To the other 70% he showed (and sold) the original blue-case design. 

* The data flew in and it's stored in an SQL database.
